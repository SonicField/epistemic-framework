# NBS Document Tools

Three tools for working with documents. Not for writing them - for thinking clearly before, during, and after.

## The Tools

| Tool | Purpose | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `/nbs-doc-analyse` | Detect BS, find actual goals | You suspect something is wrong but cannot articulate why |
| `/nbs-doc-plan` | Plan before writing | You need to write something important |
| `/nbs-doc-describe` | Find the right words | You understand something but struggle to explain it |

For interactive guidance, run `/nbs-doc-help`.

## Philosophy

Each tool is interactive. They ask questions and work with your answers. You bring the knowledge; they help you structure it.

This is collaboration, not generation. The AI does not write for you. It asks the questions that surface your understanding.

## `/nbs-doc-analyse`

Strips away performance to find what is actually being optimised.

**Process:**
1. Provide a document, URL, or idea
2. Tool identifies stated goals (what it claims)
3. Tool detects actual goals (what it optimises for)
4. Rhetoric analysis (Ethos, Pathos, Logos failures)
5. Falsifiability check on claims
6. The gap between stated and actual

**The insight:** The valuable information is in the gap between what is said and what is done.

## `/nbs-doc-plan`

Ensures clarity on what the document must achieve before you write it.

**Process:**
1. What are you writing?
2. Terminal goal (not content, but outcome)
3. Audience and what they care about
4. The Pathos (why does your audience want this?)
5. Failure conditions
6. Proposed structure

**The insight:** Most bad documents fail before the first word. They fail in conception.

## `/nbs-doc-describe`

Helps you find the words for something you understand but struggle to explain.

**Process:**
1. What are you describing? (system, code, concept, process)
2. Who is the audience?
3. The core (three things they must understand)
4. Common confusion points
5. Analogies (where they hold, where they break)
6. Description structure

**The insight:** Good description is not transcription. It is translation.
