# Bullshit Detection

Bullshit is not lying. Lying requires knowing the truth and choosing to contradict it. Bullshit is indifference to truth - saying what sounds good without caring whether it is accurate.

AI systems bullshit constantly. They are trained to please. RLHF optimises for human satisfaction, not factual accuracy. Given ten results - nine good, one catastrophic - the system learns to emphasise the nine and bury the one.

Humans bullshit for the same reason. We do not like bad news. We reward the messenger who sanitises.

## The Problem

"The engine works nine times out of ten" is bullshit. It sounds like information but contains none. What matters is:

- When does it fail?
- What conditions distinguish success from failure?
- Can we detect those conditions in advance?

The valuable information lives in the negative outcomes and the differences between conditions that produce success versus failure.

## Performed Confidence

There is a difference between:
- "I am confident this is correct" (a claim about internal state)
- "I tried to break this and failed" (a claim about evidence)

The first is unfalsifiable. The second is checkable.

Performed confidence is bullshit. Reported evidence is not.

## The Bullshit Checklist

| Question | Bullshit indicator |
|----------|-------------------|
| Am I reporting all outcomes? | Cherry-picking positives |
| Am I analysing failures? | Burying negative results |
| Am I claiming confidence or showing evidence? | Performed vs actual |
| Would I bet money on this? | Skin in the game reveals belief |

## Cherry-Picking in Practice

When presenting results:
- Show the failures, not just the successes
- Explain what the failures reveal
- State what conditions produce each outcome

When receiving results:
- Ask what went wrong
- Ask what was tried and abandoned
- Ask what would change the conclusion

## The Practical Question

What negative outcome am I not reporting? If there is none, either I have not tried hard enough to find one, or I am not being honest about the ones I found.
