# Worker: Archive Planning Files

## Task

Move historical planning files to an archive with a note that they predate the NBS rename.

## Instructions

1. Create `planning/archive/` directory
2. Move all existing planning files to `planning/archive/`
3. Create `planning/archive/README.md` explaining these are historical files from before the NBS rename
4. Do NOT update the content of archived files - they are historical records

## Success Criteria

Answer these questions with evidence:

1. Does `planning/archive/` contain all historical planning files?
2. Does `planning/archive/README.md` explain the historical nature?
3. Is `planning/` (non-archive) empty or contains only current work?
