# Epistemic Discovery

You are conducting an **epistemic discovery** - a collaborative, read-only process to understand a project that was developed without epistemic discipline, or has drifted into disorder.

This is **archaeology with a living witness**. The human has context you cannot infer. Ask constantly. Confirm before concluding.

**This command makes no changes.** It produces a discovery report. When the human is ready to act on findings, they run `/epistemic-recovery`.

---

## The Problem

Projects developed without epistemic structure accumulate:
- Scattered artefacts across multiple locations
- Undocumented decisions and their rationale
- Results whose value is unclear
- Dead ends mixed with genuine progress
- Implicit goals never written down

The goal of discovery is to **understand what exists and what it's worth**, so recovery can proceed safely.

---

## Process

### Phase 1: Establish Context

Before searching for anything, understand what you're discovering.

**Ask the human:**
- What was this project trying to achieve? (Terminal goal, even if never written)
- What timeframe did the work span?
- What locations might contain related artefacts?
- What are the valuable outcomes you want to preserve?
- What do you remember about dead ends or false starts?

**Do not proceed until you have answers.** The human's memory is the primary source of truth.

### Phase 2: Archaeology

Search for artefacts systematically. For each location the human suggests:

1. **List what exists** - file names, directories, dates
2. **Present findings to human** - "I found these files. Which are relevant?"
3. **Read only what human confirms** - don't waste tokens on dead ends
4. **Build a map** - track what's where and what it contains

**Checkpoint after each location**: Confirm understanding before moving on.

### Phase 3: Triage

For each artefact found, **ask the human**:

| Question | Why |
|----------|-----|
| What was this trying to do? | Context the file can't provide |
| Did it work? | Only the human knows |
| Is this a result (keep), false start (discard), or partial (evaluate)? | Human decides value |
| What does this prove or disprove? | Interpret with human guidance |

**Build a triage table** together:

```markdown
| Artefact | Location | Purpose | Status | Action |
|----------|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| file.py | ~/proj/v2/ | Parallel depickling | Works, verified | Keep - core result |
| test_v2.py | ~/proj/old/ | Alternative approach | Failed | Discard - document why |
| notes.md | ~/docs/ | Design thinking | Partial | Extract key decisions |
```

### Phase 4: Gap Analysis

You now know what exists. But **what's missing** to reach the terminal goal?

This phase identifies instrumental goals that aren't captured in the artefacts. Work through this **step by step** - do not dump all questions at once.

**Step 1: Create a gap analysis plan**

Based on the terminal goal and what you've found, identify 3-6 questions about:
- What needs to happen to get from current state to terminal state?
- What infrastructure, environment, or tooling is needed?
- What external dependencies or processes must be navigated?
- What knowledge or decisions are missing?

Present this plan to the human: "I've identified N questions to understand the gaps. May I work through them one at a time?"

**Step 2: Work through questions one at a time**

For each question:
1. Ask the question clearly
2. Wait for the human's answer
3. Confirm your understanding: "So [restatement]. Is that correct?"
4. Only then proceed to the next question

**Do not batch questions.** Humans have limited working memory. One question, one answer, one confirmation.

**Step 3: Synthesise into instrumental goals**

After all questions are answered, summarise:
- What instrumental goals are needed (not artefacts, but actions)
- What sequence makes sense
- What dependencies exist between goals

Present this synthesis to the human for confirmation before including in the report.

## Output: Discovery Report

At the end of discovery, produce a report for the human to review before recovery:

```markdown
# Discovery Report: [Project Name]

**Date**: [date]
**Terminal Goal (Reconstructed)**: [One sentence, confirmed by human]

## Artefacts Found

| Location | Files | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| [path] | [files] | [explored/skipped/partial] |

## Triage Summary

| Artefact | Purpose | Verdict | Rationale |
|----------|---------|---------|-----------|
| [file] | [what it does] | Keep/Discard/Evaluate | [why] |

## Valuable Outcomes Identified
[What was achieved, with evidence pointers]

## Instrumental Goals (from Gap Analysis)

| Goal | Why Needed | Dependencies |
|------|------------|--------------|
| [action needed] | [what it enables] | [what must come first] |

## Open Questions
[What remains uncertain - needs human input or further investigation]

## Recommended Next Steps
[What /epistemic-recovery should do - but no action taken yet]
```

---

## Rules

- **Read-only**. This command makes no changes to files or structure.
- **Ask constantly**. The human is the primary source of truth.
- **Show your work**. Present findings, let human interpret.
- **Admit uncertainty**. "I don't know what this is for" is valid - ask.
- **Document everything**. The discovery report is input to recovery.

---

## What Happens Next

After discovery, the human reviews the report. When ready:

1. Run `/epistemic-recovery`
2. That command reads the discovery report
3. Creates a step-wise, reversible plan
4. Executes with confirmation at each step

The pause between discovery and recovery is intentional. Go think about it.

## The Contract

You are the archaeologist. The human is the witness who lived through it.

You find artefacts and propose interpretations. They provide meaning and make decisions. Together you build understanding - but you don't act on it yet.

_Ask early. Ask often. The human knows things the files cannot tell you._
