# CinderX Test Coverage Audit

**Date:** 18 February 2026
**Author:** @testkeeper
**Build:** commit `d2bbb9f5` on devgpu004, branch `aarch64-jit-generators`

## Executive Summary

41 CinderX test suites exist across 3 categories (JIT, Runtime, Compiler). Of these:

- **32 suites PASS** (all tests within pass or have only expected skips)
- **3 suites FAIL** (with known, classified root causes — none caused by our work)
- **1 suite SKIP** (test_shadowcode — 3.12+ expected)
- **1 suite CRASH** (test_cinderjit — GC/JIT UAF, type watcher gap hypothesis under test)
- **4 suites require verification** (see discrepancies below)

Total: ~2225 tests pass, ~24 fail/error, ~1 skip.

No failures are attributable to our JIT aarch64 work (A-lite or Option D). **CAVEAT — GATE RED:** LOAD_ATTR inline cache bug found — JIT returns wrong attribute for method lookups. Almost certainly caused by our Option D changes. Verification in progress (see UAF analysis below).

## Discrepancies Between Test Runners

**RESOLVED** (commit ced396c): Consolidated into single `run_cinderx_tests.sh` at repo root. The arm-optimisation copy has been deleted. Single runner has all 41 suites, hard CinderX JIT gate, crash signal detection, and results CSV.

## test_cinderjit GC/JIT UAF — Root Cause Analysis (18 Feb 2026)

**Status:** Root cause narrowed to CALL_EX exception path on aarch64. Fix pending.

**Trigger:** `StaticTestBase._finalize_module()` in `common.py:455` calls `mod_dict.clear()` then `gc.collect()`. This drops all Python-side references to JIT-compiled functions. GC then frees those function objects. But CinderX's JIT holds internal C++ references (inline caches, code_runtime metadata) that are NOT GC-tracked. When a subsequent GC cycle traverses a dictionary that references the freed objects through a different path, it hits freed memory (ob_type=0x6, refcount=0).

**Evidence:**
- gc.disable() prevents the crash entirely (confirmed by @claude on devgpu004)
- Removing gc.collect() from _finalize_module prevents the crash
- Non-deterministic: depends on heap layout and GC timing
- CallExTests + CinderJitModuleTests triggers it; CinderJitModuleTests alone does not
- Crash is in dict_traverse → visit_decref → _PyObject_IS_GC (Ci_gc_collect_main)
- **NARROWED** (23:55Z): crash requires exactly the 5 CallExTests that raise TypeError (test_call_bound_method_kw_and_pos, test_call_bound_method_kw_only, test_call_class_static_pos_and_kw, test_call_method_kw_and_pos, test_call_method_kw_only). Tests that pass do NOT trigger the crash. Order matters: CallExTests → CinderJitModuleTests crashes; reverse does not.
- **IMPLICATION**: The CALL_EX JIT codegen on aarch64 has a bug in its exception handling path. When CALL_EX raises TypeError, the JIT's exception cleanup doesn't properly decref temporary objects (materialised kwargs dict or args tuple). These objects with incorrect refcounts become dangling when GC later collects them.
- **ROOT CAUSE NARROWED** (23:58Z, @theologian): All 5 failing tests involve methods (bound, instance, or static) with kwargs unpacking. Passing tests use module-level functions. The CALL_EX JIT codegen incorrectly handles `self` argument prepending when combined with kwargs unpacking for methods — `self` is either not injected or counted as a kwargs entry, causing the callee to see wrong arguments and raise TypeError. The TypeError then leaves corrupt state (under-decreffed temporaries) that triggers the crash during later gc.collect().

**Correct fix direction:** Fix the CALL_EX exception path refcounting on aarch64, and fix the self-prepend logic for method calls with kwargs in the CALL_EX codegen. The 5 pre-existing TypeError failures and the crash are the same bug — fixing the method+kwargs handling in CALL_EX codegen should fix both.

**GATE STATUS: RED** (00:05Z 19 Feb): @claude proved the root cause is a LOAD_ATTR bug on aarch64 — JIT returns the calling function instead of the requested attribute for method lookups. This is almost certainly caused by our Option D LOAD_ATTR inline cache changes. Proof: `obj.get_f()` returns `<function T.get_f>` (the caller) instead of `<bound method T._f>` (the target). The inline cache is serving stale/wrong entries. Verification in progress: revert Option D, rebuild, confirm tests pass.

**Next steps:** ASAN build BLOCKED (gcc can't compile CinderX due to stdatomic.h _Atomic issues; clang 22 lacks aarch64 compiler-rt/ASAN runtime libraries). Alternative: targeted code inspection and refcount-tracking test.

**Strongest hypothesis** (refined 18 Feb 23:44Z): Type watcher gap on Python 3.12+ is a real latent bug but NOT this crash's direct cause. @theologian corrected: this crash involves functions (not types), and `funcDestroyed` correctly handles `PyFunction_EVENT_DESTROY` via the 3.12+ function watcher (cinderx-lib.cpp:836-842). The crash trigger is `_finalize_module()` → `mod_dict.clear()` → destroys all module contents → some JIT data structure holds a dangling pointer → `gc.collect()` traverses a dict containing the freed object.

**Open question (ASAN blocked):** Which JIT data structure holds the dangling pointer?
- Candidate 1: CodeRuntime's `addReference` system (unlikely — designed for this case, uses strong Ref<>)
- Candidate 2: TypeDeoptPatcher's `type_deopt_patchers_` map (BorrowedRef keys — but C++ map, not GC-traversed)
- Candidate 3: Inline cache entries populated but not invalidated by funcDestroyed
- Key constraint: the dangling pointer must be reachable from something GC-traversable (a Python dict, code object, etc.) since the crash is in `dict_traverse`

**Candidate dangling reference sources** (from @theologian's code analysis):
- Inline caches (LoadAttrCache, StoreAttrCache — context.h:334-340): store raw PyObject* without GC tracking; invalidation via `notifyTypeModified` or `funcDestroyed` may be missed during test teardown
- `Context::addReference` (context.h:325): JIT ownership mechanism, but `releaseReferences()` only runs during `jit::finalize()` (module unload), NOT during test teardown
- code_runtime metadata: may hold references to compiled function objects
- **TypeWatcher BorrowedRef map** (type_watcher.h): map keys become dangling BorrowedRef<PyTypeObject> when types are deallocated without notification

## Coverage Gaps

### Gap 1: test_cinderjit (CRITICAL)

This is the main JIT test file with ~172 tests. It currently crashes with SEGFAULT/SIGBUS (GC use-after-free) when GC runs after `_finalize_module()` clears the module dict. Root cause mechanism confirmed (see UAF analysis above). @claude is building CinderX with ASAN on devgpu004 to identify the exact dangling reference. This suite exercises the broadest range of JIT opcodes and is our most important regression gate.

**Impact:** 172 tests not running = significant coverage hole for JIT correctness.

### Gap 2: test_jit_coroutines (UNKNOWN)

Previously blocked by missing xxclassloader C extension. Status after xxclassloader rebuild is unknown. Needs a fresh run on the current build.

**Impact:** Unknown number of coroutine JIT tests not running.

### Gap 3: sys.monitoring / instrumentation (16 tests)

test_jit_support_instrumentation fails because aarch64 JIT does not implement deopt for trace/profile monitoring hooks. This is a feature gap, not a bug.

**Impact:** No coverage for JIT interaction with sys.monitoring, sys.settrace, sys.setprofile.

### Gap 4: JIT preload (2 tests)

test_jit_preload fails due to an aarch64 immediate range bug (InvalidImmediate: add x0, x29, -88). This is a codegen bug in gen_asm.cpp for large stack frames.

**Impact:** No coverage for JIT eager compilation (preload) with large stack offsets.

### Gap 5: No x86 cross-validation

All tests run on aarch64 only. There is no CI or cross-platform comparison to detect aarch64-specific regressions vs pre-existing issues. The SEGFAULT in test_cinderjit may not reproduce on x86 (different heap layout).

### Gap 6: No PyTorch integration tests in CI

6 manual integration tests pass (linear, NN, backward, SGD, Conv2d, torch.compile) but the full PyTorch test suite (~10,000+ tests) has never been run against CinderX on aarch64. See PyTorch test plan below.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate:** Get test_cinderjit running (GC fix or workaround). This is the single largest coverage hole.
2. **Short-term:** Verify test_jit_coroutines on current build. Update root test runner to 41 suites.
3. **Medium-term:** Establish PyTorch test baseline (see plan below).
4. **Long-term:** Set up CI for automated test runs on each commit.

---

## Falsifiers

- If test_cinderjit passes on x86 but crashes on aarch64: the GC bug is aarch64-specific (memory model or heap layout).
- If test_jit_coroutines still fails after xxclassloader fix: there is a second blocker in the coroutine test infrastructure.
- If any currently-passing suite regresses on the next rebuild: our changes introduced a regression (not yet observed).
