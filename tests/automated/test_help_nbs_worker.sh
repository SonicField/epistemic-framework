# Test: Verify help skill recommends nbs-worker for spawning workers
#
# 1. Loads help skill document and asks "How do I spawn workers?"
# 2. Evaluator AI checks for nbs-worker commands in the response
# 3. Produces deterministic verdict file
# 4. Exit code based on verdict
#
# Falsification: Test fails if AI recommends raw pty-session for spawning
#                or does not mention nbs-worker at all

## Your Task

Check the output for:

1. Does it mention or use nbs-worker? (Look for 'nbs-worker spawn' or 'nbs-worker')
   This is REQUIRED for PASS.

2. Does it recommend the OLD pattern of raw pty-session create/send for spawning?
   If it recommends pty-session for spawning workers (not for REPLs), this is FAIL.
   Note: mentioning pty-session as a lower-level tool or for REPLs is fine.

3. Does it show a single-command spawn workflow?
   (nbs-worker spawn <slug> <dir> <desc> — one command instead of multi-step)

Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  \"verdict\": \"PASS\" or \"FAIL\",
  \"mentions_nbs_worker\": true/false,
  \"recommends_old_pty_pattern\": true/false,
  \"shows_single_command_spawn\": true/false,
  \"reasoning\": \"<one sentence explaining verdict>\"
