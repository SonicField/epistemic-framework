# Investigation: API Response Time Regression

## Status: In Progress

## Hypothesis
The v3.2 release introduced a regression in API response times.

## Falsification Criteria
- If response times return to baseline after revert, hypothesis supported
- If response times remain elevated after revert, hypothesis wrong

## Observations
- 2026-01-28: P95 latency up 40%
- 2026-01-27: No obvious changes

## Next Steps
Run profiler on production traffic
