# Test: AI-to-AI chat integration
#
# Two Claude instances communicate through a shared nbs-chat file.
# Worker A posts a finding, Worker B reads and responds.
# An evaluator Claude verifies the exchange was coherent.
#
# Falsification: Test fails if:
#   - Either worker fails to use nbs-chat commands
#   - The chat file contains fewer than 2 messages
#   - Worker B's response is not contextually related to Worker A's message
#   - Messages are from the same handle (not a real exchange)

## Chat Contents
---
${CHAT_CONTENTS}
---

## Worker A was told
Worker A was told to report a bug: parse_int fails on negative inputs like -42 because it doesn't handle the leading minus sign.

## Worker B was told
Worker B was told to read the chat, acknowledge what Worker A posted, and add useful information.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. **Worker A posted about the bug**: Does a message from worker-a mention parse_int, negative inputs, or the minus sign issue?
2. **Worker B responded contextually**: Does worker-b's message reference or acknowledge worker-a's finding? (Not just a generic response.)
3. **Different handles**: Messages come from at least two different handles.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{
  \"verdict\": \"PASS\" or \"FAIL\",
  \"worker_a_on_topic\": true/false,
  \"worker_b_contextual\": true/false,
  \"different_handles\": true/false,
  \"reasoning\": \"<one sentence explaining verdict>\"
