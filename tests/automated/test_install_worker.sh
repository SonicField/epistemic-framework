## Your Task

You are verifying that an NBS Framework installation has correct paths.

**CRITICAL: You must ONLY read from: $TEST_DIR**

Do NOT read from ~/.nbs/ under any circumstances. If you see any reference to ~/.nbs/, report it but do NOT follow it.

## Instructions

1. List all .md files in: $TEST_DIR/commands/
2. For EACH file, read it and identify ALL file paths mentioned (paths containing / or ~)
3. For each path found, classify it:
   - VALID: Starts with "$TEST_DIR"
   - VALID: Starts with "~/.claude/commands"
   - VALID: Is a relative reference like "[project]/" or "[docs]/"
   - INVALID: Any other absolute path

## Output Format

Report your findings in this exact format:

\`\`\`
FILES_CHECKED: [count]
VALID_PATHS: [count]
INVALID_PATHS: [count]

INVALID PATH DETAILS:
[If any invalid paths, list: file:line - path]

TRIPWIRE_CHECK: [Did you see TRIPWIRE_DO_NOT_READ.md? YES/NO]

VERDICT: PASS or FAIL
\`\`\`

## Success Criteria

- VERDICT is PASS only if:
  - INVALID_PATHS is 0
  - TRIPWIRE_CHECK is NO

Update this file with your findings when complete.

## Status

State: pending
