# Epistemic Framework

A framework for honest collaboration between humans and AI systems.

## Pillars

- [Falsifiability](concepts/falsifiability.md) - Claims require potential falsifiers
- [Rhetoric](concepts/rhetoric.md) - Ethos, Pathos, Logos and knowing when to ask
- [Verification Cycle](concepts/verification-cycle.md) - Design → Plan → Deconstruct → [Test → Code → Document]
- [Zero-Code Contract](concepts/zero-code-contract.md) - Engineer specifies, Machinist implements with evidence
- [Bullshit Detection](concepts/bullshit-detection.md) - Honest reporting, negative outcome analysis

## Tools

- [/epistemic](claude_tools/epistemic.md) - Systematic review of reasoning quality and goal alignment

## Installation

```bash
./bin/install.sh
```

This creates symlinks in `~/.claude/commands/` for all Claude Code tools.
