**What went well:**
-

**What didn't work:**
-

**What we can do better:**
-

**Self-check** (if workers_since_check >= 3):
- [ ] Am I still pursuing terminal goal?
- [ ] Am I delegating vs doing tactical work myself?
- [ ] Have I captured learnings that should improve future tasks?
- [ ] Should I escalate anything to human?

[Reset workers_since_check to 0 after self-check]
