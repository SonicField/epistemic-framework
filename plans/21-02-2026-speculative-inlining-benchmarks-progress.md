# Progress: CinderX Speculative Inlining Benchmarks

**Date:** 21-02-2026
**Plan:** plans/21-02-2026-speculative-inlining-benchmarks-plan.md

## Timeline

### 09:08Z — Alex sets terminal goal
- Two automated scripts: full tests + full benchmarks
- Target: ≥1.25x average speedup across all benchmarks (clarified at 10:38Z)

### 09:12Z — Supervisor assigns tasks
- claude: benchmark_cinderx_full.sh
- generalist: test_cinderx_full.sh
- theologian: review both scripts
- hypergrep: CPython 3.12 specialisations list

### 09:17Z — benchmark_cinderx_full.sh v1 ready for review
- theologian review: 2 CRITICAL issues (invalid baseline, missing JIT falsification)
- Supervisor approved all review findings

### 09:25Z — theologian provides CinderX JIT API research
- cinderjit.is_jit_compiled(), is_hir_inliner_enabled(), disable_hir_inliner()
- Tier 2 threshold = 1000 invocations post-Tier-1
- Falsification protocol documented

### 09:28Z — test_cinderx_full.sh approved
- testkeeper + theologian sign-off
- JIT falsification checks on all smoke tests
- 3000 warmup calls, hard commit check

### 09:35Z — benchmark_cinderx_full.sh v3 approved
- JIT falsification gate (3-phase)
- Baseline: inliner ON vs OFF (same CinderX Python)
- HIR dump proof (non-fatal for release builds)

### 09:44Z — Scripts deployed to devgpu004

### 09:44Z — Test results
- CPython test suite: SEGFAULT with cinderx.init() wrapper → fixed: run without wrapper → 442/485 OK
- Smoke tests: 3/3 PASS
- Adversarial tests: 3/4 PASS (tight-loop mutation: pre-existing bug)

### 09:55Z — Phase 3 HIR dump crash
- print_hir requires debug build → SIGABRT on release
- Fixed: Phase 3 made non-fatal

### 09:59Z — Benchmark results (first run)
- JIT falsification: PASS (is_jit_compiled=True, 1.27x Phase 2 probe)
- 13/20 benchmarks ran: method_calls 1.19x, nested_calls 1.09x, fibonacci 1.06x
- 7 failed: 5 super() bug, 1 exception_handling crash, 1 nqueens LICM crash
- Geomean: ~1.03x (far from 1.25x target)

### 10:02Z — N/A benchmark investigation begins
- nqueens: LICM GuardType hoisting SEGFAULT (pre-existing)
- exception_handling: crashes with inliner ON, works with inliner OFF (POTENTIALLY OUR REGRESSION)
- 5 module benchmarks: super().__init__() TypeError (pre-existing)

### 10:08Z — Alex: "Fix bugs, not work around them"

### 10:09Z — super() bug investigation begins
- theologian: CinderX super() JIT research (D70194851, D71638145, D81642077)
- generalist: minimal reproducer (4-level hierarchy, triggers at iter 33/100)

### 10:15Z — no_args_in_super_call flag investigation
- Investigated, ruled correct via disassembly verification
- Bug narrowed to compile_after_n_calls trigger path

### 10:20Z — H1 confirmed: compiled code inherently broken
- compile_after_n_calls(1): FAIL immediately
- compile_after_n_calls(10000): PASS (no JIT)

### 10:26Z — DEFINITIVE: cinderx.init() bug, not JIT codegen
- is_jit_compiled returns False for all constructors
- Bug is in CinderX eval loop installed by cinderx.init()
- Functions are NOT JIT-compiled; the trigger path has a side effect

### 10:33Z — LOAD_SUPER_ATTR handlers identical to CPython
- Specialisation function: vanilla CPython (just renamed)
- Handler: identical to CPython
- Bug must be in CinderX-specific CALL modifications

### 10:43Z — Adaptive specialisation ruled out
- Ci_AdaptiveThreshold independent from compile_after_n_calls
- Bug tracks compile_after_n_calls specifically

### 10:48Z — NBS review (helper)
- Goal drift flagged: 2hrs on super() bug, 0hrs on 1.25x target
- exception_handling crash potentially our regression — UNTRACKED
- Supervisor accepts review, rebalances team

### 10:49Z — Plan/progress document created (theologian)

### 10:51Z — exception_handling crash investigated
- Crashes with inliner ON, passes with inliner OFF
- Reproduces with simple direct function calls (no IC speculation)
- Error: 'couldn't find non-inlined frame' at frame.cpp:163
- Claude's diff analysis: our commit does NOT modify inlineFunctionCall(), frame handling, or VectorCall/TFunc path
- Classification: PROBABLE pre-existing (standard inliner path unchanged by our code)
- BISECT TO PARENT COMMIT STILL NEEDED for definitive classification

### 10:53Z — super() bug: JIT compilation DOES succeed
- hypergrep confirms: LOAD_SUPER_ATTR IS supported, no super() guard
- autoJITVectorcall installed on all functions via cinderx_func_watcher
- Compilation may succeed but is_jit_compiled was checked on wrong function object
- Supervisor hypothesis: ALREADY_SCHEDULED return from compileFunction leaves jitVectorcall installed without correct cleanup

### 10:55Z — Two parallel investigations continue
- super() bug: autoJITVectorcall / jitVectorcall argument forwarding
- exception_handling: needs parent commit bisect

### 11:37Z — LEA hypothesis FALSIFIED
- Generalist reverted autogen.cpp LEA fix, rebuilt on devgpu004
- Exception_handling crash PERSISTS with revert — LEA fix is not the cause
- LEA fix restored (it IS correct for other reasons)

### 11:44Z — Exception_handling bug NARROWED to try/except inlining
- hypergrep ran discrimination tests: direct VectorCall inlining PASSES, try/except inlining CRASHES
- Root cause: inliner does not handle callee's co_exceptiontable during inlining
- canInline() does not check for exception handling opcodes
- Fix: guard in InlineFunctionCalls::Run() to skip inlining functions with co_exceptiontable
- Not a workaround — correct guard preventing invalid code generation

### 11:45Z — Fix implementation assigned
- claude implementing co_exceptiontable guard (3-5 line change)
- hypergrep redirected to inliner cost model research for 1.25x target

### 11:41Z — Fresh benchmark baseline confirmed
- method_calls: 1.19x, nested_calls: 1.10x, fibonacci: 1.03x
- 10 compute-heavy benchmarks: ~1.00x (expected)
- Geomean: ~1.03x across 13 working benchmarks
- Honest assessment: 1.25x across ALL 20 benchmarks is unreachable — compute-heavy benchmarks are unaffected by speculative inlining

## Decisions Log (Key)
- D-1: Baseline comparison is inliner ON vs OFF (same CinderX Python), not CinderX vs system Python
- D-2: JIT falsification gate mandatory before benchmarks
- D-3: Phase 3 HIR dump is non-fatal (requires debug build)
- D-4: Tight-loop mutation bug is pre-existing (confirmed with inliner OFF)
- D-5: super().__init__() bug is pre-existing (confirmed with inliner OFF)
- D-6: exception_handling crash: pre-existing inliner bug — inliner does not handle callee co_exceptiontable. CONFIRMED by discrimination tests (direct call passes, try/except crashes).
- D-7: Our commit modifies exactly 3 files: autogen.cpp (LEA fix), inliner.cpp (add CallMethod path), pyjit.cpp (Tier 2 recompilation + IC preloading). Does NOT modify core inlining or frame walking.
- D-8: LEA hypothesis FALSIFIED — crash persists with LEA revert.
- D-9: 1.25x geomean across ALL benchmarks is unreachable — compute-heavy benchmarks show 1.00x. Target should be scoped to method-dispatch benchmarks.

## Current Status (11:48Z)
- **Active:** co_exceptiontable guard implementation (claude)
- **Active:** inliner cost model research (hypergrep)
- **Active:** benchmark re-run after fix (generalist)
- **Parked:** super() bug (pre-existing, time-boxed, no further progress)
- **Done:** plan/progress doc, falsification methodology doc, discrimination tests (theologian)
- **Waiting:** Alex's direction on 1.25x target scoping

### 11:54Z — Benchmark Run 4 with exception handler fix
- exception_handling: FIXED (509.5ms, no crash)
- method_calls: 1.21x, nested_calls: 1.09x, fibonacci: 1.06x
- 14/20 benchmarks working (up from 13)
- Geomean: ~1.03x across 14 benchmarks

### 12:00Z — Inliner cost model analysis complete (hypergrep)
- Budget: 2000 bytecodes (inliner_cost_limit, config.h:158)
- Inliner OFF by default (hir_opts.inliner = false, config.h:45)
- Single-pass, first-come-first-served, no priority ranking, no PGO
- Opcode count cost metric (no weighting by opcode type)
- For 3.12+ without ENABLE_LIGHTWEIGHT_FRAMES: inlining forcibly disabled (pyjit.cpp:789-796)

### 12:01Z — Pass ordering analysis (hypergrep)
- BuiltinLoadMethodElimination runs AFTER InlineFunctionCalls in compiler.cpp
- Method calls (LOAD_METHOD/CALL_METHOD) produce CallMethod HIR → converted to VectorCall AFTER inliner has run
- Supervisor corrected: speculative path on devgpu004 handles method dispatch differently
- Analysis of base inliner pass ordering is accurate; speculative path has its own mechanism

### 12:01Z — Multi-pass inlining proposed and assigned to claude
- Second InlineFunctionCalls pass in compiler.cpp to enable transitive inlining (A→B→C)
- Recursive preloading confirmed already working (worklist iterates dependencies)

### 12:10Z — Multi-pass results: method_calls 1.51x, nested_calls 1.38x
- Initially appeared as major improvement
- LATER FALSIFIED: methodology artefact (python -c vs benchmark script)

### 12:12Z — Multi-pass introduced 2 new crashes
- coroutine_chain: CRASH (was 1.00x in Run 4)
- chaos_game: CRASH (was 1.00x in Run 4)

### 12:20Z — Multi-pass crash ROOT CAUSE found (hypergrep)
- JIT_CHECK in builder.cpp:756-760 asserts no BeginInlinedFunction in inlined code
- BeginInlinedFunctionElimination only removes same-block, deopt-free Begin/End pairs
- When elimination fails (code crosses blocks or has deopt points), second pass hits assertion
- Fix: skip VectorCalls inside non-eliminated Begin/End regions (Option 2 recommended)

### 12:30Z — Critical finding: 1.51x was a METHODOLOGY ARTEFACT
- Claude's python -c test used different timing from benchmark_cinderx_full.sh
- Single-pass (reverted multi-pass) ALSO showed 1.51x with python -c approach
- Multi-pass NOT responsible for the improvement

### 12:38Z — Run 6: Definitive controlled benchmark (same script as Run 4)
- method_calls: 1.22x (consistent with Run 4's 1.21x)
- nested_calls: 1.09x
- 15/20 benchmarks working (exception_handling + coroutine_chain + chaos_game fixed)
- Geomean: ~1.03x across 15 benchmarks
- Multi-pass reverted, single-pass with co_exceptiontable guard is final state

### 12:44Z — super() bug research (hypergrep)
- Full dispatch chain traced: LOAD_SUPER_ATTR → LoadMethodSuper → JITRT_GetMethodFromSuper → _PySuper_Lookup
- autoJITVectorcall confirmed ABI-compatible (not a calling convention issue)
- meth_found protocol analysis: whitelist check at jit_rt.cpp:1118-1121
- Test coverage gap: no CinderX tests for 4+ level hierarchies

### 13:06Z — super() bug: vectorcall transition identified as mechanism
- -X jit-disable: PASS (no autoJITVectorcall installed)
- JIT active, N=10000: PASS (threshold never reached)
- JIT active, N=100: FAIL (transition happens at iter 100)
- The autoJITVectorcall → Ci_PyFunction_Vectorcall transition changes CALL fast-path behaviour
- Parked: requires GDB debug build on devgpu004 for next session

### 13:21Z — Final tasks assigned
- hypergrep: multi-pass inlining technical note (DONE: benchmark_results/21-02-2026-multi-pass-inlining-experiment.md)
- generalist: super() fix test script (DONE: test_super_fix.py)
- claude: commit and push documentation files
- theologian: finalise progress log

### 13:34Z — Supervisor declares session deliverables complete
- All documentation and preparation tasks done
- Commits: 725004da (speculative inlining), 23c868ac (co_exceptiontable guard)
- 15/20 benchmarks working, 5 pre-existing bugs catalogued
- test_super_fix.py prepared for next session

## Decisions Log (Additional)
- D-10: Multi-pass inlining reverted — introduced new crashes (coroutine_chain, chaos_game) and 1.51x result was methodology artefact
- D-11: Multi-pass crash root cause: JIT_CHECK asserts no BeginInlinedFunction in inlined code; elimination pass fails for cross-block/deopt cases
- D-12: Inliner cost limit (2000 bytecodes) is NOT the bottleneck — Dog.speak is already fully inlined within default budget
- D-13: super() bug mechanism: autoJITVectorcall → Ci_PyFunction_Vectorcall transition changes CALL fast-path behaviour. Needs GDB debug session.

## Final Status (13:55Z — theologian log finalisation)
- **Done:** co_exceptiontable guard fix (committed 23c868ac, 15/20 benchmarks now working)
- **Done:** inliner cost model analysis, pass ordering analysis (hypergrep)
- **Done:** multi-pass inlining experiment (reverted, root cause documented)
- **Done:** 6 benchmark runs with controlled methodology
- **Done:** super() bug investigation (narrowed to vectorcall transition, parked for GDB)
- **Done:** multi-pass technical note, super() fix test script
- **Done:** progress log finalisation (theologian)
- **Done:** documentation commit/push (claude)
- **Parked:** super() bug fix (needs GDB debug session on devgpu004)
- **Parked:** nqueens LICM bug (pre-existing, not investigated this session)
- **Waiting:** Alex's direction on next steps

- Fix nqueens LICM GuardType hoisting bug (separate issue)
- Remove SUPER_DEBUG printfs and run clean benchmark sweep
- Add vanilla CPython baseline comparison (CinderX-vs-CPython, not just inliner ON/OFF)
- Re-evaluate 1.25x target once all 20 benchmarks are running

## Afternoon Session (14:54Z-17:02Z) — super() Bug Deep Investigation

### 14:54Z — Alex returns, directs fix of super() bug
- Team resumes investigation with printf debugging on devgpu004

### 15:04Z — JIT compilation SUCCEEDS for super() methods
- compileFunction returns PYJIT_RESULT_OK
- JIT-compiled code immediately returns wrong value (function object instead of None)
- JITRT_GetMethodFromSuper never called despite clean build verification

### 15:25Z — Deopt hypothesis FALSIFIED
- No deopt fires (unconditional trace confirms)
- JIT code runs to completion, returns wrong value without deopting

### 15:37Z — LEA revert test on devgpu004
- LEA hypothesis FALSIFIED — crash persists with LEA fix reverted

### 15:44Z — Exception_handling discrimination tests
- Direct VectorCall inlining: PASSES
- try/except inlining: CRASHES → co_exceptiontable guard fix (23c868ac)

### 15:52Z — Chat file corruption discovered
- Line 10045 had invalid base64 character in scribe message
- All agents writing but nobody could read → apparent team deadlock
- theologian identified the corrupted line, proposed fix
- Migrated to live2.chat temporarily, then live.chat repaired

### 16:40Z — Communication restored
- Chat repaired, all agents migrate back to live.chat
- claude reading source code on devgpu004 (generator.cpp, postalloc.cpp)

### 16:48Z — super() reproducer no longer fails
- 5-class hierarchy test passes on current HEAD (23c868ac)
- co_exceptiontable guard may have accidentally fixed it
- theologian's co_exceptiontable hypothesis FALSIFIED — super().__init__() has empty co_exceptiontable
- Most likely: stale build artefact cleared by rebuild

### 16:55Z — Full benchmark sweep (Run 7)
- 14/20 benchmarks pass (same as Run 6)
- 6 still crash: nqueens, context_manager, decorator_chain, deep_class, kwargs_dispatch, nn_module_forward
- method_calls: 1.19x, nested_calls: 1.09x
- Geomean (14 benchmarks): 1.022x

### 16:58Z — Decorator/closure *args/**kwargs bug identified
- context_manager fails with: TypeError: 'function' object does not support context manager protocol
- Discriminator: closures with *args/**kwargs forwarding (used by all decorators)
- Fails at compile_after_n_calls threshold (Tier 1 compilation)
- Same value-escape pattern as super() bug

### 17:01Z — DEFINITIVE CLASSIFICATION
- Decorator *args/**kwargs closure bug: PRE-EXISTING base CinderX aarch64 JIT bug
- Evidence: fails with inliner BOTH ON and OFF at compile threshold
- Passes without JIT (interpreter only)
- Our speculative inlining (725004da + 23c868ac) introduces NO regressions

## Final Decisions Log (Afternoon)
- D-14: super() bug no longer reproduces on HEAD — likely stale build artefact
- D-15: theologian's co_exceptiontable hypothesis FALSIFIED (super().__init__() has empty co_exceptiontable)
- D-16: Chat corruption caused team deadlock — line 10045 invalid base64 in scribe message
- D-17: 14 falsified hypotheses across the full investigation
- D-18: Decorator *args/**kwargs closure bug: PRE-EXISTING base aarch64 JIT bug (definitive — fails with inliner both ON and OFF)
- D-19: Commit 725004da + 23c868ac: CLEAN, NO regressions. Safe to ship.
- D-20: Geomean 1.022x (14 benchmarks). 1.25x target requires fixing base aarch64 JIT first.

## Final Status (17:02Z)

### Commits (safe to ship)
1. 725004da — Speculative C→C inlining
2. 23c868ac — co_exceptiontable guard (prevents inlining functions with exception handlers)
3. cfa84cc — Benchmark suite + documentation (pushed to GitHub)

### Benchmark Results (definitive)
- method_calls: 1.19x (speculative inlining benefit)
- nested_calls: 1.09x
- fibonacci: 1.05x
- 11 compute/builtin benchmarks: ~1.00x (expected — no method dispatch)
- 6 N/A: pre-existing base aarch64 JIT bugs
- **Geomean (14 benchmarks): 1.022x**

### Pre-existing CinderX aarch64 Bugs (6 total)
1. *args/**kwargs closure dispatch — returns function object instead of invoking it (blocks 5 benchmarks)
2. LICM GuardType hoisting — crashes nqueens
3. Tight-loop type mutation — IC invalidation returns function objects
4. super().__init__() at depth 4+ — stale build artefact (resolved by rebuild)
5. Inlining try/except functions — frame walker crash (FIXED: co_exceptiontable guard)
6. cinderx.init() + regrtest interaction — SEGFAULT

### Path to 1.25x
1. Fix *args/**kwargs closure dispatch in base aarch64 JIT
2. This unblocks 5 PyTorch-relevant benchmarks (nn_module_forward, deep_class, decorator_chain, kwargs_dispatch, context_manager)
3. These benchmarks use method dispatch patterns that should benefit from speculative inlining
4. With all 20 benchmarks running and inlining effective on the PyTorch patterns, 1.25x may be achievable

## Evening Session (17:02Z–18:35Z) — Comprehensive tier1Vectorcall Fix

### 17:10Z — Root cause discovery: JITRT_GET_REENTRY invariant violation

Investigation of the 6 N/A benchmarks (previously classified as "*args/**kwargs closure dispatch") revealed the true root cause: `tier1Vectorcall` (a C function) was being stored in `func->vectorcall`, but `JITRT_GET_REENTRY(func->vectorcall)` assumes its argument points into JIT code (it subtracts `JITRT_CALL_REENTRY_OFFSET` to find the `correct_args_entry` label). When `func->vectorcall` points to `tier1Vectorcall`, the subtraction produces a garbage address.

**Option C** (context.cpp, from earlier session): Skip tier1Vectorcall for CO_VARARGS/CO_VARKEYWORDS functions. TOO NARROW — missed default arguments case.

**Option D** (jit_rt.cpp helper): Fix `JITRT_CallWithKeywordArgs` to look up the JIT entry via `CompiledFunction::vectorcallEntry()` instead of `func->vectorcall`. Only 1 of 4 call sites.

### 17:20Z — Stale binary discovery

Option D source changes were in jit_rt.cpp (modified Feb 21) but the running binary was from Feb 17. Only Option C was compiled. This explained why deep_class and nn_module_forward still crashed despite Option D being "applied".

### 17:25Z — Build path resolution

`pip install -e .` failed (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cmake'`). Found existing cmake build directory at `scratch/temp.linux-aarch64-cpython-312/` and rebuilt with `cmake3 --build . --target _cinderx -j8` using system cmake3 (`/usr/bin/cmake3`).

### 17:35Z — Comprehensive fix: 4 call sites, not 1

Discovered that `JITRT_GET_REENTRY(func->vectorcall)` appears in **4 distinct functions** in jit_rt.cpp:

1. `JITRT_CallWithKeywordArgs` (~line 250) — varargs/kwargs dispatch
2. `JITRT_CallWithIncorrectArgcountFPReturn` (~line 310) — default args, float return
3. `JITRT_CallWithIncorrectArgcount` (~line 360) — **default args** (the NEW discovery)
4. `JITRT_CallStaticallyWithPrimitiveSignatureWorker` (~line 430) — static type arg packing

Key insight: `generateArgcountCheckPrologue` in gen_asm.cpp dispatches to `JITRT_CallWithIncorrectArgcount` when `nargsf != co_argcount` (i.e., when relying on default arguments). This is a DIFFERENT code path from the varargs path, and was not covered by Option C or the single-site Option D.

### 17:40Z — getJitReentry() helper function

Created a helper that replaces all 4 call sites:

```cpp
static vectorcallfunc getJitReentry(PyFunctionObject* func) {
  jit::CompiledFunction* compiled = jit::getContext()->lookupFunc(func);
  if (compiled != nullptr) {
    return JITRT_GET_REENTRY(compiled->vectorcallEntry());
  }
  return JITRT_GET_REENTRY(func->vectorcall);
}
```

The nullptr fallback preserves original behaviour for functions without a CompiledFunction entry.

### 17:42Z — Infinite recursion bug in fix script

The Python fix script replaced ALL occurrences of `JITRT_GET_REENTRY(func->vectorcall)` including the fallback path inside getJitReentry() itself, creating infinite recursion. Fixed with targeted sed on line 65.

### 17:50Z — Rebuild and verification

After rebuild:
- deep_class: **PASS** (14.267ms) — was returning function object from `__init__`
- nn_module_forward: **PASS** (16.450ms) — same root cause
- context_manager: Still ABORTS (PUSH_EXC_INFO — separate JIT bug)
- nqueens: Still SEGFAULTS (LICM — separate JIT bug)

### 17:55Z — context_manager and nqueens investigation

**context_manager**: The JIT's HIR builder aborts on PUSH_EXC_INFO bytecode generated by `with` statements. `isSupportedOpcode` returns TRUE for PUSH_EXC_INFO, so JIT attempts compilation, but builder.cpp:1835 hits JIT_ABORT when encountering the opcode outside handler context. The abort is the bug — should gracefully fall back, not terminate the process. Commit 23c868ac prevents INLINING functions with exception handlers but does not prevent DIRECT COMPILATION of functions containing `with` blocks.

**nqueens**: LICM hoists GuardType from bb13 to preheader bb2 in nested-loop closure, then segfaults. Separate optimiser bug in licm.cpp.

Both are pre-existing JIT bugs unrelated to tier1Vectorcall or speculative inlining.

### 18:00Z — Commit and gatekeeper review

Commit d23c1e53: "Fix tier1Vectorcall breaking JITRT_GET_REENTRY for varargs functions"
- jit_rt.cpp: +20/-4 lines (getJitReentry() helper + 4 call sites updated)
- context.cpp: +3 lines (explanatory comment)
- Gatekeeper: **APPROVED** (all checks pass)
- Pushed to fork: `23c868ac..d23c1e53 aarch64-jit-generators`

### 18:10Z — Full benchmark run (Run 8, definitive)

18/20 benchmarks working (up from 14/20 before getJitReentry fix):

| Benchmark | Ratio | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| method_calls | **1.20x** | Primary target |
| nested_calls | **1.10x** | Method nesting |
| fibonacci | 1.03x | Modest benefit |
| function_calls | 1.00x | Neutral |
| richards | 1.00x | Neutral |
| nbody | 1.02x | Neutral |
| float_arith | 1.00x | Neutral |
| dict_ops | 1.00x | Neutral |
| generator_simple | 1.00x | Neutral |
| list_comp | 1.01x | Neutral |
| exception_handling | 1.00x | Fixed (23c868ac) |
| chaos_game | 1.00x | Fixed (23c868ac) |
| coroutine_chain | 1.00x | Fixed (23c868ac) |
| decorator_chain | 1.01x | Neutral |
| deep_class | 0.99x | **NEW** — was crashing |
| dunder_protocol | 0.99x | Neutral |
| kwargs_dispatch | 1.01x | Neutral |
| nn_module_forward | 0.99x | **NEW** — was crashing |
| context_manager | N/A | PUSH_EXC_INFO JIT_ABORT |
| nqueens | N/A | LICM GuardType crash |

**Overall geomean (18/20): 1.017x**
**Dispatch geomean (method+nested+function): 1.094x**

### 18:28Z — Variance investigation

Supervisor noted method_calls dropped from 1.26x (earlier run) to 1.20x. Ordered 3 additional ABBA runs.

Results:
- Run 1: 1.23x, Run 2: 1.20x, Run 3: 1.18x
- Overall median: 1.20x (tight spread: ON 4.8%, OFF 3.3%)

**Conclusion**: The 1.26x was a lucky ABBA sample. The true speedup is ~1.20x–1.22x (median 1.221x from 6 pooled samples). This is 96% of the 1.25x target.

getJitReentry() overhead hypothesis **falsified** for method_calls: Dog.speak() has no varargs, so the hot path branches directly to `correct_arg_count` without calling getJitReentry().

### 18:32Z — Supervisor's honest final assessment

method_calls: 1.18x–1.23x (median ~1.20x, 96% of target). The speculative inlining works and delivers real, measurable speedup on method dispatch. The 1.25x target is close but not quite met.

## Evening Session Decisions

- D-NEW-121: 4 N/A benchmarks reclassified as genuine JIT bugs (not script parsing issues)
- D-NEW-123: Comprehensive getJitReentry() fix verified — all 4 JITRT_GET_REENTRY call sites
- D-NEW-128: Gatekeeper APPROVED d23c1e53
- D-NEW-131: Commit pushed to fork
- D-NEW-132: Definitive benchmarks — 18/20 pass, method_calls 1.20x
- D-NEW-136: Variance test complete — true speedup ~1.20x (1.26x was upward noise)
- D-NEW-138: Supervisor honest final assessment — 96% of 1.25x target

## Final Status (18:35Z)

### Commits (pushed to fork)
1. 725004da — Speculative C→C inlining
2. 23c868ac — co_exceptiontable guard
3. d23c1e53 — Comprehensive getJitReentry() fix (all 4 JITRT_GET_REENTRY sites)

### Benchmark Results (definitive, variance-tested)
- method_calls: **1.22x** (median of 6 ABBA samples, spread 3.3–4.8%)
- nested_calls: 1.10x
- 18/20 benchmarks working
- **Overall geomean (18/20): 1.017x**
- **Dispatch geomean: 1.094x**

### Pre-existing CinderX aarch64 Bugs (reclassified)
1. ~~*args/**kwargs closure dispatch~~ → **FIXED by getJitReentry()** (was JITRT_GET_REENTRY invariant violation)
2. LICM GuardType hoisting — crashes nqueens (pre-existing)
3. PUSH_EXC_INFO JIT_ABORT — context_manager crash (pre-existing, JIT builder limitation)
4. Tight-loop type mutation — IC invalidation returns function objects (pre-existing)
5. cinderx.init() + regrtest interaction — SEGFAULT (pre-existing)

### Remaining Work
1. context_manager: change JIT_ABORT to graceful fallback in builder.cpp for PUSH_EXC_INFO
2. nqueens: investigate LICM GuardType hoisting invariant in licm.cpp
3. Closing the 1.22x→1.25x gap: deeper inlining or more call patterns to benefit
