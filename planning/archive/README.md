# Historical Planning Files

This archive contains planning and progress files from before the project was renamed from "Epistemic Framework" / "AI Teams" to "NBS" (Noise-Based Signalling).

These files are preserved as historical records and have not been modified. They may contain references to:

- `epistemic-framework` (now `nbs`)
- `ai-teams` (now `nbs-teams`)
- Related terminology from the original naming scheme

For current planning files, see the parent `planning/` directory.
