# x86_64 Regression Testing Plan for CinderX Generator Changes

**Date:** 18 February 2026
**Author:** theologian (NBS agent)
**Context:** Pythia flagged that the GenDataFooter** slot-counting mismatch (computeSlots +1 vs _PyFrame_NumSlotsForCodeObject) may not be aarch64-specific. This plan covers how to verify x86_64 is not affected and establish a regression baseline.
**Status:** PLAN ONLY — not yet approved for execution.

## Terminal Goal

Verify that CinderX generator JIT on x86_64 is not affected by the same GenDataFooter** pointer corruption that crashes aarch64 generators with parameters or free variables.

## Falsifier

If x86_64 generators with parameters (co_argcount > 0) or free variables (co_nfreevars > 0) crash or produce incorrect results under JIT compilation, the hypothesis "this is an aarch64-only bug" is falsified.

## Phase 1: Source Verification (no build required)

**Goal:** Determine whether x86_64 and aarch64 use the same GenDataFooter** placement mechanism.

**Steps:**

1. Read `computeSlots()` in the CinderX source — identify where the +1 for GenDataFooter* is added
2. Read `_PyFrame_NumSlotsForCodeObject()` in CPython 3.12 — confirm it does NOT include the +1
3. Read the x86_64 generator codegen path in `gen_asm.cpp` — identify how GenDataFooter** is accessed on x86
4. Compare with the aarch64 path — are the offset calculations identical, or does x86 use a different mechanism?

**Expected outcomes:**
- If x86 uses the same `gen + tp_basicsize + NumSlotsForCodeObject * itemsize` calculation: the bug is latent on x86. Proceed to Phase 2.
- If x86 uses a different mechanism (e.g., a dedicated field, a different offset calculation): the bug is aarch64-specific. Document the difference and close this plan.

**Time estimate:** Source read only. No build, no SSH, no test execution.

### Phase 1 Results (completed by testkeeper, 09:32Z 18 Feb)

**VERDICT: The bug is structural, not aarch64-specific. Proceed to Phase 2.**

Evidence from testkeeper's source read:
1. `computeSlots()` (generators_mm.cpp:21-26) — NO architecture guard. The +1 for GenDataFooter* pointer is generic code.
2. `jitGenDataFooterPtr()` (gen_data_footer.cpp:10-24) — NO architecture guard. Same offset calculation on both architectures.
3. `jit_rt.cpp:745` — NO architecture guard. Footer pointer stored into localsplus slot on both architectures.
4. **The deopt guards in pyjit.cpp are ALL `#if defined(__aarch64__)` only.** x86_64 generators are JIT-compiled WITHOUT deopt guards.

This means x86_64 CinderX is currently JIT-compiling generators with the same slot-count mismatch. Either: (a) x86 generators crash and nobody noticed, or (b) x86's calling convention/codegen masks the bug (e.g., the footer pointer is never re-read after corruption, or the corruption doesn't occur due to different argument binding order).

Phase 2 testing is needed to distinguish (a) from (b).

## Phase 2: x86_64 Test Environment

**Goal:** Establish a test environment for CinderX on x86_64.

**Prerequisites:**
- Access to an x86_64 machine with Python 3.12 and CinderX source
- The same CinderX commit that is deployed on devgpu004 (aarch64)

**Steps:**

1. Identify available x86_64 machine (devvm, devserver, or local)
2. Clone or sync the CinderX source at the same commit
3. Build CinderX: `./configure --with-pydebug && make -j$(nproc)`
4. Verify basic JIT works: `python -c "import cinderjit; cinderjit.force_compile(lambda: 1)"`

## Phase 3: Generator-Specific Regression Tests

**Goal:** Run targeted generator tests that exercise the GenDataFooter** pointer path.

**Test script (`test_generator_regression.py`):**

```python
"""
Regression tests for GenDataFooter** pointer corruption.
Tests generators with parameters, free variables, and combinations.
Each test exercises the GenDataFooter** pointer by:
1. Creating a generator with the specified characteristics
2. JIT-compiling it (force_compile or threshold=1)
3. Exercising next/send/close/throw
4. Verifying correct results

**Execution modes:**

1. **Threshold mode (production-like):**
   ```bash
   PYTHONJITCOMPILATIONTHRESHOLD=1 python test_generator_regression.py
   ```

2. **Force-compile mode (stress test):**
   ```python
   # Wrap each generator with cinderjit.force_compile before use
   ```

3. **Existing test suite:**
   ```bash
   PYTHONJITCOMPILATIONTHRESHOLD=1 python -m pytest cinderx/test_cinderx/ -k generator
   ```

## Phase 4: Comparison

**Goal:** Compare x86_64 results against aarch64 results.

| Test | aarch64 (expected) | x86_64 (to verify) |
|------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Zero-arg generators | PASS | ? |
| Parameterised generators | CRASH (nil footer) | ? |
| Closure generators | CRASH (COPY_FREE_VARS corruption) | ? |
| send/close/throw | Depends on above | ? |
| yield from | Depends on above | ? |

**If x86_64 passes where aarch64 crashes:** The bug is aarch64-specific (different codegen path) or masked (x86 uses the slot but reads it back before it's overwritten). Need to verify with GDB whether the GenDataFooter** pointer is actually correct or just happens to not be dereferenced at the crash point.

**If x86_64 also crashes:** The bug is structural (computeSlots vs _PyFrame_NumSlotsForCodeObject mismatch). Fix must be applied to both architectures.

## Dependencies

- Phase 1 can be done immediately (source read only, no machine access needed)
- Phases 2-4 require an x86_64 machine with CinderX build capability
- This plan does not block Phase 5e/5f work on aarch64

## Risks

- x86_64 may pass all tests even with the latent bug if the corrupted slot is never dereferenced on x86 (different codegen path or calling convention)
- Testing with threshold=1 and force_compile may not exercise the same paths as production workloads
- The test script above is not exhaustive — real-world generators may have additional characteristics (decorators, class methods, nested scopes) that trigger the bug
